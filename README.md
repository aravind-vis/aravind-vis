## Hi 👋 I'm Aravind

I'm a Principal Engineer / Architect with **20+ years of experience** designing and evolving
large-scale, distributed platforms. Over the years, my work has naturally converged at the
intersection of **architecture, platform engineering, AI governance, and organizational
effectiveness**.

I enjoy working on systems that have to **hold up over time** — systems that scale, stay
operable in production, and remain trustworthy as complexity and organizational size grow.
I care deeply about **clear domain boundaries**, thoughtful trade-offs, and technical
decisions that still make sense years later.

## 🧭 What I spend most of my time on

### Platform & Distributed Systems Architecture
I design and evolve high-throughput, fault-tolerant systems with a strong bias toward
clarity of ownership, predictable behavior in production, and operational simplicity
over clever abstractions.

### Domain-Driven Design at scale
I’ve spent a lot of time helping teams define bounded contexts, align technical boundaries
with organizational reality, and avoid the slow erosion that comes from accidental coupling
between domains.

### AI Platform Design & Governance
As AI systems started becoming part of core platforms, I focused on building **governance
models that don’t kill innovation** but still create accountability and trust.

This includes:
- Designing model lifecycle and accountability frameworks
- Building **AI-assisted developer tooling**
- Ensuring AI-enabled systems are observable and operable in production

### API & Integration Strategy
I approach APIs as long-lived products: designed first, versioned carefully, and governed
just enough to stay consistent without becoming a bottleneck.

### Engineering Effectiveness & Technical Leadership
A lot of my impact comes from raising the technical bar across teams — through design
reviews, mentorship, and standards — and by building **developer tooling and automation**
that makes the right path the easy one.

### Production-first thinking
I treat observability, reliability, security, and cost as design constraints from day one.
Zero-downtime deployments, blue/green and canary strategies, and operational guardrails
aren’t “nice to have” — they’re part of the architecture.

## 📌 What this GitHub space is for

This GitHub space reflects how I think and work:

- Architecture explorations and design notes  
- Platform, infrastructure, and AI governance experiments  
- Opinionated but pragmatic approaches to system and platform design  
- Code and documentation written with **production reality** in mind  

I value **clarity over cleverness**, **stability over novelty**, and **decisions that age well**.

## ⚡ Perspective

Good architecture is less about frameworks and more about
**constraints, trade-offs, and knowing what *not* to build** —
especially when AI enters the system.
